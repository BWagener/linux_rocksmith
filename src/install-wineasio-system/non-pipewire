<summary>Use the AUR</summary>

`yay` is an AUR helper, which I will use as an example. It will install the AUR package for you. You can do this in other ways too, of course

```
yay -S wineasio --noconfirm
```

Notes:

* If it exits with an error, try and remove `--noconfirm`.

wineasio is now installed on your native wine version.

	<summary>How to check if it's installed correctly</summary>

	find /usr/lib/ -name "wineasio.dll"
	find /usr/lib/ -name "wineasio.dll.so"
	find /usr/lib32/ -name "wineasio.dll"
	find /usr/lib32/ -name "wineasio.dll.so"

This should output 4 paths (ignore the errors).
