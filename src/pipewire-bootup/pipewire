(You don't always have to do this, but this give me the most reliable experience) As soon as you see the games window, take the focus away from it, eg. on a different window. Don't focus Rocksmith until the logos start to appear (it's usually the same amount of time). At this point, RS_ASIO is initialized and you can start playing.
